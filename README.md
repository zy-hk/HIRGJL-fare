"$$$_deco" is a decoder

"$$$_enco" is an encoder

"$$$_text" is in project (you are welcome to edit just deplicate and add your name to the end

just add stuff to the decode/encode i guess btw i think you can use whatever language just copy and paste your code here you don't have to but i lost the keyword once so i think it might be safter and easier to find to have all the ciphers in like a giant repos on the cloud so nothing is lost

columnar is killing me

btw did you figure out the title?

<strong>Cipher list</strong>

Caesar - complete (though I’d like to try it for fun)<br>
Keyword - complete (need to put input validation) (need to finish deco)<br>
Polybius - complete (needs final finishing though, and I could add a keyword option)<br>
Rail fence - mostly complete (needs implementing and testing)<br>
Vignere - complete<br>
Columnar transposition - in progress (tis hell)<br>
Foursquare cipher - Not in progress<br>
Hill cipher - Not in progress (barely a clue of how this one works)<br>
Nihilist cipher - not in progress, appeared last year <br>
Substitution - complete <br>
Morse code - not in progress (find and replace exists, so not really necessary) (thats really easily we could do that in a lunchtime)<br>
Affine cipher - complete-ish <br>
Atbash cipher - complete <br>
