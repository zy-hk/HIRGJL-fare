"$$$_deco" is a decoder

"$$$_enco" is an encoder

"$$$_text" is in project (you are welcome to edit just deplicate and add your name to the end

just add stuff to the decode/encode i guess btw i think you can use whatever language just copy and paste your code here you don't have to but i lost the keyword once so i think it might be safter and easier to find to have all the ciphers in like a giant repos on the cloud so nothing is lost

columnar is killing me

btw did you figure out the title?
