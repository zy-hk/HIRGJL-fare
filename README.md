"$$$_deco" is a decoder

"$$$_enco" is an encoder

"$$$_text" is in project (you are welcome to edit just deplicate and add your name to the end

just add stuff to the decode/encode i guess btw i think you can use whatever language just copy and paste your code here you don't have to but i lost the keyword once so i think it might be safter and easier to find to have all the ciphers in like a giant repos on the cloud so nothing is lost

columnar is killing me

btw did you figure out the title?

Cipher list

Caesar - complete (though I’d like to try it for fun)
Keyword - complete (need to put input validation) (need to finish deco)
Polybius - complete (needs final finishing though, and I could add a keyword option)
Rail fence - mostly complete (needs implementing and testing)
Vignere - complete
Columnar transposition - in progress (tis hell)
Foursquare cipher - Not in progress
Hill cipher - Not in progress (barely a clue of how this one works)
Nihilist cipher - not in progress, appeared last year 
Substitution - complete
Morse code - not in progress (find and replace exists, so not really necessary) (thats really easily we could do that in a lunchtime)
Affine cipher - complete-ish
Atbash cipher - complete
